### Another Stop in Buffalo

Since the last post I've spent another week at the Corning internship, and another weekend in Buffalo. I seem to have a tendency to alternate weekends between Corning/Elmira and Buffalo, mostly because I continue to forget things in Buffalo that I need to grab, giving me another excuse for some time there. Which I don't mind at all - I like my bike route along the Erie Canal and seeing the school crew. I'm undoubtedly due for another trip soon.

The bike ride along the canal practically killed me, mostly because it was much longer than I normally ride (I'm not confident enough to disclose the distance), but I believe - much to the opposition of some of my _strongly_ (but perhaps rightfully) skeptical friends - that the recent donation of blood was one of the larger contributors to my lack of athleticism that day. Nonetheless I prevailed, and not without reward - I snapped a cool photo of a [swing bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_bridge) on the canal, shown below:

It looks like they've turned it into a landmark since I've noticed much newer/higher bridges across the canal in the same area. Plus, look at all that rust.

Site updates:
- Click on my face on the [homepage](home.php) to shuffle through some other profile pictures of me. When you're as attractive as I am you need a lot of photos to really get the point across.
- Check out the blog sidebar. I finally got the archive to latch on to the top of the page instead of floating in it's initial location. I'm still not entirely sure how it works, but hey that's what [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) is for, amiright?
