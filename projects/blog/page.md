### Look it's a page file!

I'm gonna type a bunch of stuff here and it's just going to pretend to be important things and descriptions about how I did the project and stuff. So here goes. It'd be cool to have a castle and play giant professional games of hide and seek in it. Or paintball. Which I've never played, but I'm sure it'd be cool. I played airsoft for a while in middle school/high school so I kindof know what I'm talking about but not really because we used the biodegradable pellets that never really seemed to fly right.
