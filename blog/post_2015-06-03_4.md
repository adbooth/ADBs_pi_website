### Day 3 of the Internship

Just finished up day 3 of my "official" Corning Inc internship and I am *real* tuckered out. My previous 3 posts (which were mostly test posts) were submitted at about 2AM last night, fitting right in to my recent schedule of staying up late coding and then waking up to somehow stay awake during work. Coffee has naturally become a necessary accomplice, though it is out of the ordinary for me. I tell my fellow interns this but they find it hard to believe considering grabbing a cup has been the first thing I've done every morning they've known me.

Being a year behind, most of my home friends are starting their careers and thus are moving away, including one of my closest who's Last Hurrah I hosted at my place last night. This didn't help the lack-of-sleep situation, but honestly it was completely out of my control. I'm far from regretting it though: it was a good time with a good crew of people.

Hopefully I've learned my lesson concerning hitting the hay early, but given the TODO list that still exists for my website (

- Fix footer text on mobile devices
- Take some photos and write some summaries for project page
- Get project page rendering from JSON on server
- Fix archive container ordering for mobile blog
- Make mobile archive container toggle expand on tap

) it's possible the pattern will repeat yet again. Here's to breaking habits, no matter how productive they are.
