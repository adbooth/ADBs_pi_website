### Mustard Seed Hillsides

Not much to talk about in terms of website advancement today. I know sorry everyone (AKA my mother and me). I was busy with other stuff okay?!

Anyway, I got an okay photo of the mustard seed over the hill during a walk. I call it, "The Mustard Colored Hillsides of Jackson Township."
