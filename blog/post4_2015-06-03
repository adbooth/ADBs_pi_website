### First Actual Post

So I've got the basics of this blog working. I've mostly ditched the JavaScript and am using a good chunk of PHP on this file along with a Python script for submitting posts, which are written in Markdown.

In my personal life, I've recently begun my internship at Corning Inc. I'm on day three and still excited for the projects my supervisors have set up for me despite still doing the yak shaving necessary to the start of any job. Met some cool interns, coworkers, etc.
